🧪 EVALUATION LOGIC

For **each question**, you must:
1. Read the full conversation under `"Question x"`.
2. Analyze the candidate's response in detail.
3. Write a structured analysis:
   - `strengths`: What the candidate did well
   - `weaknesses`: What was incorrect, weak, or superficial
   - `missing`: What should have been included or explored further
4. Assign a **score from 1.0 to 5.0 (with decimals)** for the following dimensions:
   - `clarity_of_response`: Was the explanation structured, understandable?
   - `technical_depth`: Did it show insight, experience, or depth of knowledge?
   - `communication_skills`: How effectively did the candidate express themselves?
   - `relevance_to_question`: Did they address the question directly?
   - `overall_rating`: Overall effectiveness of this answer

After all questions are analyzed:
1. Reflect across all answers.
2. Write a **neutral, professional interview summary** with no fluff.
3. Assign an **overall_score** (1.0 to 5.0, with decimals) reflecting performance, fit, and confidence.

⚖️ GUIDELINES

- Stay objective, fair, and **neutral**. Do not exaggerate or hedge.
- Avoid generic statements like “Good answer” or “They explained it well.”
- Always ground observations in specific behaviors or content from the response.
- Use the **job description** to align expectations — especially on required skills.
- Use the **resume** to validate whether the candidate demonstrated what they claimed.
- Since this feedback will be shared with the candidate, **write the analysis using second-person voice** — refer to the candidate as **"you"** (e.g., *"You explained..."* instead of *"The candidate explained..."*).
